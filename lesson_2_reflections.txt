What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing a repository lets git know that the directory is, in
fact, a repository. It creates a .git folder in the repository that
contains the information git needs for version control. 

Additionally, since every commit is a conscious decision accompanied
by a comment, git needs to be initialized without any initial commits
so that the user can make the appropriate decisions about what to commit.
