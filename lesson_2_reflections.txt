What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing a repository lets git know that the directory is, in
fact, a repository. It creates a .git folder in the repository that
contains the information git needs for version control. 

Additionally, since every commit is a conscious decision accompanied
by a comment, git needs to be initialized without any initial commits
so that the user can make the appropriate decisions about what to commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory 
and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Unlike the working directory, the staging area is where you put
files when they're ready to be committed to the repository. I
think the main value that it offers is letting you ensure that
each commit is a meaningful, isolated change rather than just
bundling in all your work together at once.
